### Miguel's Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of configuration files (dotfiles).

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal backup and a detailed log of my Arch Linux environment. This allows me to easily bootstrap a new machine and keep my setup consistent.

Disclaimer: These configurations are highly tailored to my specific hardware, workflow, and preferences. You are welcome to browse, fork, and draw inspiration from them. However, please review the files carefully before applying them to your own system. ***I take no responsibility for any issues or damages that may arise from using them.***

## The Setup
