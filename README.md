Miguel's Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of configuration files (dotfiles).

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal backup and a detailed log of my Arch Linux environment. This allows me to easily bootstrap a new machine and keep my setup consistent.

Disclaimer: These configurations are highly tailored to my specific hardware, workflow, and preferences. You are welcome to browse, fork, and draw inspiration from them. However, please review the files carefully before applying them to your own system. I take no responsibility for any issues or damages that may arise from using them.

Installation

Feel free to adapt this process for your own needs. This is how I deploy my configurations on a new system.

    Warning: The following commands will replace your existing .config directory. Please back it up first.



Acknowledgment

This setup is a constant work in progress. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always learning and happy to share ideas.
